                        <p>Even though the agricultural industry is crucial for food production. It contributes to land pollution in several ways. Excessive use of chemical based fertilizers and pesticides contaminate the soil and ecosystem. This is damaging to biodiversity and to human health. Improper irrigation practices can damage land plant growth productivity, this happens through a process called salinization.</p>
                        <p>New technologies will automate irrigation and fertilization using efficient computing. This will protect the land from over irrigation and improve efficient pesticide/fertilizer coverage. Sustainable agriculture can help address land pollution issues while ensuring food security.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Fast Fashion Industry</h2>
                        <p>The fast fashion industry is another major contributor to land pollution. Our consumer society demands for the rapid turnover of cheap, disposable clothing.</p>
                        <p>This demand generates a massive amount of clothing waste. These textiles often end up in landfills or are incinerated, both devastating to the environment. The production process to create cheap fashion products often involves the use of toxic chemicals. Unfortunately, these chemicals often end up in our soil and water.</p>
                        <p>To reduce the impact of fast fashion on land pollution, individuals should choose to buy sustainable clothing. By continuing to spread awareness on the issue, we can urge the industry to adopt eco-friendly practices and to manage chemical waste.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Next to oil, fashion in its broadest sense, fast fashion, to leather to denim, is the next biggest industrial polluter of the world's waterways.</blockquote>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Tourism</h2>
                        <p>One of the biggest polluting factors in the world right now is tourism. While there are many benefits to tourism such as becoming one with nature and seeing the beautiful parts of our world, giving this access to humans comes with consequences. Those consequences are destroying that beauty. Tourism creates many different pollutants such as air pollution and noise pollution.</p>

                        <p>      Air Pollution</p>
                        <p>While the visit to these places is beautiful, you must think about the trip's consequences. As of right now, tourism creates 8% of global emissions. Airfare causes an extreme amount of CO2 in the atmosphere since most air travel is due to tourism. But cars are the biggest perpetrator of air pollution when it comes to tourism. This comes as a no-brainer since our society is so dependent on them. As of right now the best thing we can do is cut down on air travel.</p>
                        <p>      Noise Pollution</p>
                        <p> Noise pollution is something that really isn't talked about. Noise pollution is when different activities result in harmful degrees of noise that can affect both humans and wildlife. These high noise levels which come from vehicles and machinery can become dangerous and create lifelong effects. Humans can have problems related to noise such as- “...stress related illnesses, high blood pressure, speech interference, hearing loss, sleep disruption, and lost productivity” (EPA.gov) For wildlife, they can be affected in these ways- “...animal communication, mating behavior, foraging behavior, and spatial orientation on land and in aquatic ecosystems” (NYC.gov)</p>
