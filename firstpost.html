                        <h2 class="section-heading">Industrial Waste and Land Pollution</h2>
                        <p>Industrial activities have always  been a major contributor to land pollution. The combination of improper disposal of chemical waste, heavy metals and other toxic substances are causing soil contamination and soil degradation.</p>
                        <p>This release poisons land and the surrounding environment. Damaging it for centuries down the line. Additionally, its consequences don't stop at the soil, the release finds its way into the water system posing risk to human health too.</p>
                        <p>To combat the issue of industrial waste and its effect on land pollution, we can expose the truth about industrial waste management. Spreading awareness on this issue could bring the problem to a greater audience which could lead to better management practices. Voting for leaders who will enforce regulations to minimize industrial land pollution is another great way to do your part.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Urbanization - Deforestation</h2>
                        <p>One direct consequence of the rapid growth of urban population is extreme and rapid urban expansion. With that, forests and land are being destroyed to provide lumber and resources. Foreign flora are brought in to replace the indigenous flora, as well as for aesthetic purposes, bringing and spreading diseases which further destroys habitats and ecosystems. It also takes land away which desperately needs to be used as cropland to feed the growing population. Kaifang Shi and others said, “continuous urban expansion has directly led to the rapid reduction of cropland because more than 60% of the world's irrigated cropland is located near urban areas.” Countries that are facing unprecedented urban expansion such as Asia and Africa face the obstacle of meeting sustainable development goals as their expansion negatively affects global food security.</p>
                        <p>However, there are ways to combat this and help the planet heal. Urban expansion can be built up instead of out, utilizing engineering to use more skyscrapers instead of smaller buildings. When harvesting lumber and cutting down trees, replant immediately and throughout in order to replace what was destroyed. Keep invasive species off the land and actively educate on taking care of indigenous flora and fauna in the area. Use sustainable resources in the massive development projects, consciously trying to use materials that will be able to break down in the years after use is done.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Tourism</h2>
                        <p>Many individuals treat the Earth as their personal garbage can, leaving litter in preserved areas and tourist destinations. For instance, Global Trash Solutions reports that the National Park Service collects approximately 70 million pounds of waste in US national parks each year. This careless behavior not only creates an eyesore but also encourages others to join in.</p>

                        <p>One potential solution is to install more trash and recycling receptacles along trails and in tourist spots, providing convenient locations for visitors to dispose of their waste. By making proper waste disposal more accessible, we can help reduce littering and protect the natural beauty of these sites.</p>
